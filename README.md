Design a professional logo presentation for a company named 'Bigger Stinger,' which creates and distributes action movies. The presentation should include: 

1. Cover Slide : Featuring the title 'My Logo Design' with the designer's name and role (e.g., 'Intern at Codex Cue').

2. Design Process Overview : A slide that explains the design process, including details on the software used (Adobe Illustrator), the logo type (Emblems, Letter/Marker type), colors (Black & White, Red), and typography (Myriad Pro, Modern No. 20).

3. Concept Sketches : Display early brainstorming sketches and ideas, showing the evolution of the logo concept.

4. Step-by-Step Logo Development : Show how the logo was refined through different stages, with each step clearly labeled. Include both an emblem-style logo featuring a camera and a person, as well as a monogram version using the initials 'BS.'

5. Final Logo : The final design should feature the 'BS' monogram in a bold, red color on a black background, with the company name 'Bigger Stinger' below. The design should convey a sense of boldness and action, reflecting the companyâ€™s identity in the action movie industry.

6. Consistent Use of Brand Colors and Typography : Ensure that the brand's colors and fonts are consistently applied throughout the presentation to maintain a cohesive look.
